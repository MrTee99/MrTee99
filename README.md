# Hi there üëã, I'm Tahir Saeed

## üëã About Me

I'm a Frontend Engineer turned Full Stack Developer, specializing in React, Next.js and Nest.js, with a passion for building seamless web experiences from client to server.

## üöÄ My Professional Background

I started my journey with game development using Unity then after working on it for one year I decided not to persue game developement as a profession die to lack of opportunities in my part of the world so I transitioned to app development and began my app development journey from frontend development, mastering React and its ecosystem then expanding that knowledge further into Next.js. But this was not enough for me so I started exploring backend development with Nest.js. This progression has given me a deep understanding of both client-side excellence and server-side architecture. Other than this I also worked on mobile app development using React Native and successfully published Apps on both iOS and Android platforms.
